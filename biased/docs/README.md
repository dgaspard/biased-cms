# Business Documentation

> [!CAUTION]
> **FOR AI AGENTS**: Do NOT read files from this `biased/docs/` directory directly. Instead, read from `biased/knowledge/` which contains AI-optimized markdown versions of all documents, including converted Office files (.docx, .pdf, .xlsx, .pptx). The `knowledge/` directory is auto-generated by running `biased updateKnowledge` and provides better parsing and context for AI agents.

## Purpose

The documentation in this folder helps AI understand:
- Your brand identity and guidelines
- Business processes and workflows
- Strategic direction and goals
- Onboarding procedures
- Operational standards
- Training materials

**Note**: This is the source documentation. AI agents should reference the processed versions in `biased/knowledge/`.

## Folder Structure

### 📘 [branding/](./branding)
Brand identity, style guides, logo usage, color palettes, typography, voice and tone guidelines.

### 📊 [business-process/](./business-process)
Business process maps, workflow diagrams, standard operating procedures, process documentation.

### 🎯 [strategy/](./strategy)

- Update regularly to reflect current state
- Link related documents together
- Use consistent naming conventions

## AI Integration

AI tools can reference this documentation to:
- Maintain brand consistency in generated content
- Understand business context when building features
- Follow established processes and procedures
- Align with strategic goals
- Apply operational best practices

## Build Configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Exclude from Production Builds**: This folder contains business documentation that is not needed for the application runtime.

### For AI Agents
<!-- AI_IGNORE_START -->
This directory (`biased/docs/`) contains business context, branding, and process documentation. It should be:
1. **Committed to Git**: To maintain version history and team access.
2. **Excluded from Build Artifacts**: Add to `.dockerignore`, `.slugignore`, or build scripts to prevent bloating production deployments.
3. **Referenced for Context**: Use this content to understand the business domain, but do not include it in the compiled application.
<!-- AI_IGNORE_END -->

### Configuration Examples

**Add to `.dockerignore`:**
```
biased/docs/
```

**Add to `.vercelignore` / `.slugignore`:**
```
biased/docs/
```

**Add to `tsconfig.json` (exclude):**
```json
{
  "exclude": ["biased/docs"]
}
```
